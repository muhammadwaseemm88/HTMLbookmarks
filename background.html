        <h2>Fox.</h2>
        <article>
          Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several
          genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright,
          triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail
          ("brush"). Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true fox" group of
          genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are
          always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the
          paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group,
          which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] Foxes
          live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread
          species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized
          subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with their
          widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in
          popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The
          hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in
          Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers
          to various parts of the New World.

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            The word fox comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic
            *fuhsaz.[nb 1] This in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European *puḱ-,
            meaning 'thick-haired; tail'.[nb 2] Male foxes are known as dogs, tods
            or reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though
            the last name is not to be confused with a distinct species called kit
            foxes. Vixen is one of very few words in modern English that retain the
            Middle English southern dialect "v" pronunciation instead of "f" (i.e.
            northern English "fox" versus southern English "vox").[3] A group of
            foxes is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.[4][5]

            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <h4>General morphology</h4>
            Foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family
            Canidae such as wolves and jackals, while they may be larger than some
            within the family, such as raccoon dogs. In the largest species, the red
            fox, males weigh on average between 4.1 and 8.7 kilograms (9 and 19+1⁄4
            pounds),[7] while the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs just 0.7
            to 1.6 kg (1+1⁄2 to 3+1⁄2 lb).[8] Fox features typically include a
            triangular face, pointed ears, an elongated rostrum, and a bushy tail.
            They are digitigrade (meaning they walk on their toes). Unlike most
            members of the family Canidae, foxes have partially retractable
            claws.[9] Fox vibrissae, or whiskers, are black. The whiskers on the
            muzzle, known as mystacial vibrissae, average 100–110 millimetres
            (3+7⁄8–4+3⁄8 inches) long, while the whiskers everywhere else on the
            head average to be shorter in length. Whiskers (carpal vibrissae) are
            also on the forelimbs and average 40 mm (1+5⁄8 in) long, pointing
            downward and backward.[2] Other physical characteristics vary according
            to habitat and adaptive significance.
